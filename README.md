# SmartKubeDeployer

Ethereum Smart Contract Deployment on Kubernetes with Web3.py

This Python script is designed to help deploy and manage Ethereum smart contracts on a Kubernetes cluster using the Web3.py library. It provides a simple and efficient way to create, deploy, and interact with Ethereum smart contracts on a Kubernetes cluster.
Installation

To use this script, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can install it using your system's package manager or by downloading it from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, you can install the required dependencies using pip, the Python package installer. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

pip install web3 kubernetes

This will install the Web3.py and Kubernetes Python libraries, which are required to deploy and manage Ethereum smart contracts on a Kubernetes cluster.
Usage

To use this script, you will need to have a running Kubernetes cluster with a configured Ethereum node. You can use a public Ethereum node or set up your own Ethereum node using software like Geth or Parity.

Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster and Ethereum node, you can run the script using the following command:

css

python deploy_contract.py --contract-name <CONTRACT_NAME> --contract-abi <CONTRACT_ABI> --contract-bytecode <CONTRACT_BYTECODE> --gas-price <GAS_PRICE> --gas-limit <GAS_LIMIT> --kube-config <KUBE_CONFIG> --kube-namespace <KUBE_NAMESPACE>

This command will deploy the specified Ethereum smart contract to the Kubernetes cluster, using the specified contract name, ABI, bytecode, gas price, and gas limit. It will also use the specified Kubernetes configuration file and namespace.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the Web3.py library. You can use the contract object to call functions and read data from the contract.
